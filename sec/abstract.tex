\begin{abstract}
	My ongoing research program concerns the combinatorial and computational aspects of algebraic topology with impact in applied mathematics and lattice field theory. As a member of Kathryn Hess' group, I wrote the mathematical content of a grant approved for over 1 million USD.
	With the support of \grantName\ I will collaborate with Bruno Vallette, Gr\'egory Ginot and other members of LAGA, expanding our understanding of operadic structures on cellular spaces, finer invariants of persistent homology, and the connection between lattice field theories and factorization algebras.
