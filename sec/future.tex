\subsection{Explicit Lie models for connected spaces} \label{ss:lie models}

Over $\Q$, a chain approximation to the diagonal can be symmetrized, giving rise to a cocommutative coalgebra structure on cellular chains.
This coalgebra cannot be made simultaneously coassociative, but this relation can be imposed in a derive sense through a family of coherent chain homotopies -- which also respect certain symmetry constrains -- and give rise to a so called $C_\infty$-coalgebra structure.
One can think of $C_\infty$-coalgebras in terms of the somewhat more familiar notion of $A_\infty$-coalgebra where cocommutativity is satisfied strictly.
As a manifestation of Koszul duality, a $C_\infty$-coalgebra structure on cellular chains is equivalent to a differential on the completion of the free graded Lie algebra generated by the cells shifted downwards in degree by one.
This relates $C_\infty$-coalgebras to deformation theory through Deligne's principle.
For cell complexes whose closed cells have the $\Q$-homology of a point, Dennis Sullivan provided in \cite{sullivan2007appendix} a local inductive construction defining a $C_\infty$-coalgebra structure on their cellular chains.
We reprint a challenge he posted regarding the resulting structure.
\begin{displaycquote}[p.2]{lawrence2014interval}
	\textsc{Problem}. Study this free differential Lie algebra attached to a cell complex, determine its topological and geometric meaning as an intrinsic object.
	Give closed form formulae for the differential and for the induced maps associated to subdivisions.
\end{displaycquote}
As proven by Quillen, the quasi-isomorphism type of this $C_\infty$-coalgebra is a complete invariant of the rational homotopy type of simply-connected spaces.
For the $C_\infty$-coalgebra structure on the interval, Dennis and Ruth Lawrence addressed the challenge reprinted above introducing a formula for it which can be interpreted in terms of parallel transport of flat connections \cite{lawrence2014interval}, and for which the subdivision map is described by the Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff formula.

To generalize Quillen's equivalence of homotopy categories to one between (not necessarily 1-connected) simplicial sets Buijs, F{\'e}lix, Murillo, and Tanr{\'e} provided in \cite{buijs2020liemodels} an axiomatic characterization of a $C_\infty$-coalgebra structures on the chains of standard simplices extending the Lawrence--Sullivan structure.
Their construction, also presented independently by Bandiera and Robert-Nicoud using operads, agrees after linear dualization with the one obtained by Cheng and Getzler in \cite{getzler2008transfering}, where they showed that the Kontsevich--Soibelman sum-over-trees formula defining the transfer of $A_\infty$-algebras through a chain contraction induces a transfer of $C_\infty$-algebras.
This allowed them to construct a $C_\infty$-algebra structure on simplicial cochains by transferring Sulivan' polynomial differential forms \cite{sullivan1977infinitesimal} through Dupont's contraction.
The resulting description is given in terms of rooted trees.

$C_\infty$-coalgebras are controlled by the operad $\com_\infty$ which is the Koszul resolution of the operad $\com$, i.e., the cobar construction applied to the suspension of the cooperad $\lie^{\mathrm c}$, the Koszul dual cooperad of $\com$.
Another interesting resolution of $\com$ is constructed concatenating the bar and cobar constructions.
This resolution method is an algebraic version of the $W$-construction of Boardman--Vogt.
In \cite{vallette2020higherlietheory}, Daniel Robert-Nicoud and Bruno Vallette studied coalgebras over this resolution of $\com$, which they termed $CC_\infty$-coalgebras.
They constructed on the chain of standard simplices natural $CC_\infty$-coalgebra structures and described them explicitly using bicolored trees.

Despite the explicit constructions reviewed above, the problem quoted earlier related to closed form formulae remains open.
At LAGA with Bruno Vallete (supporting this application) we will attack this problem from several angles.
One possible avenue to generalize to cubical chains the formula defining the Lawrence--Sullivan $C_\infty$\-/coalgebra on $\gchains(\gcube)$, is to define the tensor product of $C_\infty$-coalgebras and then extend it monoidally to all cubes via the isomorphism $\chains(\cube^n) \cong \gchains(\gcube)^{\ot n}$.
The monoidal structure on the category of $A_\infty$-coalgebras is defined through a chain approximation to the diagonal of the Stasheff polytopes compatible with the operad structure, a diagonal interpreted geometrically by Masuda--Thomas--Tonks--Vallette in \cite{vallette2021associahedra}.
Unfortunately, the resulting $A_\infty$-coalgebra on $\gchains(\gcube)^{\ot 2}$ is not $C_\infty$.
This could be corrected through an algebraic symmetrization of the associahedral diagonal, and deeper understanding of the space of diagonals of polytopes.

\subsection{Fiber polytopes and Steenrod diagonals} \label{ss:polytopes}

Together with Guillaume Laplante-Anfossi and Bruno Vallette we are exploring the geometry of higher diagonals of convex polytopes.
This work connects to higher category in the form pioneered by Kapranov and Voevodsky \cite{kapranov1991polycategories}.
We have already achieved substantial progress in the study of higher Steenrod diagonals using the notion of fiber polytopes \cite{billera1992fiber.polytopes}.
Namely, we introduced a generalization of the Masuda--Thomas--Tonks--Vallette construction of a cellular diagonal from a admissible vector, to the construction of a Steenrod diagonal from an admissible orthonormal frame.
This is a very exciting connection bringing convex geometry, higher categories, and homotopy theory closer together, from which a vast area of research opens.
Several projects are growing from this connection whose completion will involve Ralph Kaufmann, Guillaume Laplante-Anfossi, Viktoriya Ozornova, Bruno Vallete and other researchers.

\subsection{Odd prime Steenrod operations: persistence theory and Khovanov homology} \label{ss:odd prime steenrod operations}

In work being finalized, with Federico Cantero-Mor\'{a}n we introduced a description of Steenrod operations at the simplicial cochain level that is dual to the one given in \cite{medina2021maysteenrod}.
This is a generalization of the description in \cite{medina2021newformulas} of cup-$i$ products to cup-$(p,i)$ products.
There are two sources of motivation for this result.
On one hand, for applications in persistent homology or computational topology more broadly, this description leads to faster algorithms computing Steenrod operations of finite simplicial complexes, as illustrated for the even prime in \cite{medina2021newformulas}.
On the other hand, this dual description allowed Cantero-Mor\'an to define Steenrod operations at the even prime on Khovanov homology \cite{cantero-moran2020khovanov}.
We will use our dual description of cup $(p,i)$-products to define said operations on Khovanov homology at odd primes as well.
We also plan to implement algorithms resulting from these formulae for the study of knots and links.
This project will involved several graduate students and other young researcher, for which some financial support has already been secured.

\subsection{Homotopical algebraic data analysis and AI} \label{ss:ai}

Topology can complement traditional approaches to machine learning and data analysis by providing global summaries of complex relational structures.
The added information is model-independent and highly resistant to noise.
Designing reliable AI systems is a multi-faceted challenge and homotopical algebra can be used to tackle the following core aspects of the problem:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Robustness to noise and adversarial attacks: deep learning models are surprisingly susceptible to small perturbations, and this can lead to unexpected failures in deployed systems.
	\item Generalizability to unseen data: large models can overfit the data they are trained on and thus fail to generalize to data in deployment.
\end{itemize}
Traditional regularizers, one of the primary tools used to tackle the above challenges, impose penalties on representations that exhibit undesirable properties such as exploding gradients or highly complicated geometric structures.
By studying the topology of the weight space and decision boundaries of trained models, we will validate on real-world data the assumption that robustness is linked to less cumbersome topologies.
This will enable to create performant topological regularizers that improve the resilience and generalization power of new models.

To quantify the topological complexity of these spaces and device such regularization procedures, developments from the sub-field of homotopical algebraic data analysis, such as Steenrod persistence modules, are fundamental.
Gr\'egory Ginot (supporting this application) has made substantial contributions to this rapidly growing field \cite{ginot2021multiplicative}.
Together with part of \giottoTDA's team, Gr\'egory, and some of his collaborators in the Grand Paris area, we will develop -- at all stages from theory and algorithms to implementation and deployment -- novel homotopical invariants that can be used for these and similar challenges.
International collaborations are also envision, in particular, with the Laboratory for Topology and Neuroscience at EPFL, where as a member I wrote the mathematical content of a grant on this topic awarded for over 1 million USD.
This project developed in the context of a private-public technology transfer partnership.
I see knowledge transfer efforts as a central part of my role as a research mathematician.

\subsection{Symmetry protected topological phases and cochain constructions} \label{ss:spt phases}

A central problem in physics is to define and understand the moduli ``space'' of quantum systems with a fixed set of invariants, for example their dimension and symmetry type.
In condensed matter physics, quantum systems are presented using \textit{lattice models} which, intuitively, are given by a Hamiltonian presented as a sum of local terms on a Hilbert space associated to a lattice in $\R^n$.
We think of these as defined on flat space.
One such system is said to be \textit{gapped} if the spectrum of the Hamiltonian is bounded away from $0$, and two Hamiltonians represent the same \textit{phase} if there exists a deformation between them consisting only of systems that remain bounded from below.

Given a lattice model, using cellular decompositions and state sum type constructions one can often compute the corresponding \textit{partition functions} on spacetime manifolds from actions expressed in terms of gauge fields represented by cochains and cochain level structures: Stiefel--Whitney cochains, cup-$(p, i)$ products (\cref{ss:cup-i}, \cref{ss:may steenrod}) and Cartan/Adem coboundaries (\cref{ss:cartan}, \cref{ss:adem}) among others.
Subdivision invariance gives rise to a functorial TQFT, which in the \textit{invertible} case is expected to be controlled by a generalized cohomology theory \cite{freed2021reflection}.
The cochain level structure used in the definition of the cellular gauge theory is interpreted from this point of view as describing a cochain model of the Postnikov tower of the relevant spectrum.
For example, fermionic phases protected by a $G$-symmetry are believed to be classified by applying to $BG$ the Pontryagin dual of spin bordism \cite{kapustin2015cobordism, kapustin2017fermionic}.
Building on these insights, A. Kapustin proposed a structural ansatz in low dimensions that Greg Brumfiel and John Morgan verified by constructing cochain models of certain connective covers of said spectrum \cite{brumfiel2016pontrjagin, brumfiel2018pontrjagin} using a formula of mine \cite{medina2020cartan}.

Another important viewpoint on topological field theories is provided by the theory of factorization algebras, an area of expertise of Gr\'egory Ginot (supporting this application) \cite{ginot2015factorization.algebras}.
With the support of the \grantName\ we will deepen the understanding of SPT phases by connecting these multiple point of view: lattice models, discrete gauge theories, stable homotopy theory, functorial field theories, and factorization algebras.
This is a long term project, but a first concrete objective is the description of the signature of 4 manifolds through a combinatorial local state sum formula.
Dennis Sullivan and Andrew Ranicki have partial results in general $4k$-dimensions \cite{sullivan1976signature}, and the importance of this question in 4 dimensions has been highlighted by Peter Teichner here at the MPIM.
